    About the workshop
  </h4>
  <p class="justify">
    Our workshop is aimed at providing hands-on training to young students and
    researchers in â€œhandling small animals (mice), ethics, the basics of animal
    house management, different research methodologies for animal research, and
    future perspectives on inter-disciplinary and multi-disciplinary research
    opportunities." In addition, the workshop also aims to put forward an effort
    to minimise the gap between inter-disciplinary and multi-disciplinary
    research opportunities for the well-being of humankind. Participation will
    enhance knowledge of science and contribute to developing multi-dimensional
    research ideas and opportunities. Participants with a certificate of
    participation can add to their skills, which can boost their openness and
    opportunities abroad for higher studies.
